Project Overview
In this culminating project, you will apply the knowledge and skills gained throughout this course to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for special education professionals. Your system will assist in creating Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals for students with disabilities that align with industry standards and educational frameworks.

The system will take student information (including assessment results, interests, and needs) as input and generate appropriate measurable postsecondary goals and short-term objectives that are aligned with both industry standards and state educational content standards.

Learning Objectives
This project addresses the following course learning objectives:


Project Requirements
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing (10 points)
Collect and preprocess relevant documents including:
Occupational Outlook Handbook from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/)
State educational standards for employment skills (e.g., 21st Century Skills)
Sample IEP goals and transition planning documentation
Implement effective text extraction and chunking strategies
Create and store appropriate embeddings for efficient retrieval
2. RAG Pipeline Implementation (20 points)
Develop a retrieval component that can effectively find relevant information from:
Career requirements and standards from the Occupational Outlook Handbook
Educational standards that align with a student's career interests
Best practices for IEP goal development
Implement a generation component that:
Creates well-formed, measurable postsecondary goals
Develops aligned short-term objectives/benchmarks
Ensures compliance with IDEA 2004 requirements for transition planning
3. Prompt Engineering (10 points)
Create effective prompts that:
Extract relevant information from student profiles
Guide the model to generate appropriately structured goals
Ensure alignment between postsecondary goals, industry standards, and educational standards
Include appropriate instructions for handling missing information or ambiguous cases
4. User Interface (5 points)
Build a simple interface using Streamlit or Gradio that:
Allows users to input student information (age, grade, interests, assessment results)
Displays generated IEP goals and objectives
Shows the alignment between goals and relevant standards
Provides explanations of how the goals connect to the student's interests and needs
5. Documentation and Analysis (5 points)
Document your approach, including:
Data collection and preprocessing methods
Embedding and retrieval strategies
Prompt engineering decisions
Evaluation of system performance
Analyze strengths and limitations of your approach
Suggest potential improvements
Sample Data
Below is a case study similar to what your system should be able to process:

Case Study: Clarence

Student Information:

15-year-old sophomore with a behavior disorder
Completed the O*Net Interest Profiler assessment
Shows strong interest in the "Enterprising" category
Career interests: retail sales, driver/sales worker
Prefers hands-on learning over academic instruction
Assessment Results:

O*Net Interest Profiler indicates strength in Enterprising activities
Career suggestions include retail salesperson or driver/sales worker
Student interview ("Vision for the Future") indicates interest in working at Walmart
Expected Output:

Measurable postsecondary goals:

Employment: "After high school, Clarence will obtain a full-time job at Walmart as a sales associate."
Education/Training: "After high school, Clarence will complete on-the-job training provided by Walmart and participate in employer-sponsored customer service workshops."
Measurable annual goal aligned with standards:

"In 36 weeks, Clarence will demonstrate effective workplace communication and customer service skills in role-play and community-based instruction settings by appropriately greeting customers, maintaining eye contact, listening actively, and responding to customer questions in 4 out of 5 observed opportunities."
Alignment to standards:

Occupational Outlook Handbook standards for Retail Sales Workers
State 21st Century Skills standards
Short-term objectives/benchmarks that support the annual goal

Implementation Guidelines
Data Sources:

Download and process the Occupational Outlook Handbook
Collect state educational standards (you may choose any state's standards)
Gather sample IEP goals and transition planning documents
Organize data into appropriate categories for retrieval
RAG Pipeline:

Use a vector database (FAISS, Chroma, etc.) for efficient retrieval
Implement an embedding model (SentenceTransformers, OpenAI Embeddings, etc.)
Develop a retrieval strategy that finds the most relevant information
Create prompts that effectively utilize retrieved information
Interface:

Build a user-friendly interface that collects student information
Display generated goals, objectives, and alignments
Include explanations of how the goals connect to standards
Testing:

Test your system with the sample student profile
Evaluate the quality and relevance of the generated goals
Assess alignment with standards and student needs
Deliverables
Code Repository:

Complete source code with documentation
Requirements file listing all dependencies
README with setup and usage instructions
Documentation of your results and challenges (could be just a report or a simple 2 mins video as well)
Evaluation Criteria
Functionality (40%): Does the system work as expected? Can it generate appropriate goals based on student information?
Technical Implementation (30%): Quality of code, effectiveness of RAG implementation, and prompt engineering
Documentation (30%): Completeness and clarity of documentation
